# Complete Guide to React Hooks

React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class component.

## What are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They were introduced in React 16.8.

## useState Hook

The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]); // Only re-run if count changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Custom Hooks

You can create your own hooks to reuse stateful logic:

```javascript
function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);
  const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);

  return { count, increment, decrement, reset };
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always call hooks at the top level** - Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
2. **Use the dependency array correctly** - Include all values from component scope that are used inside the effect
3. **Separate concerns** - Use multiple `useEffect` hooks for different concerns
4. **Create custom hooks** - Extract complex logic into reusable custom hooks

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a powerful way to manage state and side effects in functional components. They make your code more readable and reusable while maintaining the same functionality as class components.

> **Tip**: Start by converting simple class components to functional components with hooks, then gradually work on more complex ones.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
